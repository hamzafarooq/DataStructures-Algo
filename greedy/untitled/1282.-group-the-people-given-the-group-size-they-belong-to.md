# 1282. Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To

There are `n` people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a **unique ID** from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given an integer array `groupSizes`, where `groupSizes[i]` is the size of the group that person `i` is in. For example, if `groupSizes[1] = 3`, then person `1` must be in a group of size `3`.

Return _a list of groups such that each person `i` is in a group of size `groupSizes[i]`_.

Each person should appear in **exactly one group**, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, **return any of them**. It is **guaranteed** that there will be **at least one** valid solution for the given input.  


```python
class Solution:
    def groupThePeople(self, groupSizes: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        count = collections.defaultdict(lambda: [[]])
        for i, size in enumerate(groupSizes):
            if len(count[size][-1]) < size:
                count[size][-1].append(i)
            else:
                count[size].append([i])
        #print(count)
        return [grp for v in count.values() for grp in v]
```
