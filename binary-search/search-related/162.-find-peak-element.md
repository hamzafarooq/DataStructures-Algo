# 162. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`.  


```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left =0
        right = len(nums)-1
        while(left < right):
            mid = left +(right-left+1)//2 # Right biased mid as left = mid in else condition # prevent infinite loop
            if nums[mid] < nums[mid-1]: # False condition # Dec function # go left # Find Last False i.e the Last elem for which this condition will be False 
                right = mid - 1
            else: # decreasing so peak will be before mid or it can be mid
                left = mid
        return left
```
