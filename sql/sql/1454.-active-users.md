```sql

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
the id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the account id and the user name of each account.


+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| login_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
This table contains the account id of the user who logged in and the login date. A user may log in multiple times in the day.

Accounts table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Winston  |
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+

Logins table:
+----+------------+
| id | login_date |
+----+------------+
| 7  | 2020-05-30 |
| 1  | 2020-05-30 |
| 7  | 2020-05-31 |
| 7  | 2020-06-01 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-03 |
| 1  | 2020-06-07 |
| 7  | 2020-06-10 |
+----+------------+

Result table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+

```

User Winston with id = 1 logged in 2 times only in 2 different days, so, Winston is not an active user. 

User Jonathan with id = 7 logged in 7 times in 6 different days, five of them were consecutive days, so, Jonathan is an active user.



```sql

# Write your MySQL query statement below

select 
    distinct a.id, c.name
from 
    Logins a join Logins b
on
    a.id = b.id and
    datediff(b.login_date,a.login_date) between 1 and 4
join Accounts c on
    a.id = c.id
group by a.id, a.login_date
having count(distinct b.login_date) >= 4



```

Another solution

```sql

# Write your MySQL query statement below

with temp0 as
(
select
    id, login_date, 
    dense_rank() over (partition by id order by login_date) as rnbr
from
    Logins

 ),

 


temp1 as
(

select
    id,login_date, rnbr,
    DATE_ADD(login_date, INTERVAL -rnbr DAY) as Groupings
    from temp0

),



answer_tbl as

(

select 
    id,min(login_date) as first_login, max(login_date) as second_login, 
    Groupings, count(id) as logins, 
    datediff(max(login_date),min(login_date)) as duration
    
from
    temp1
group by id,Groupings
    having datediff(max(login_date),min(login_date)) >= 4
order by id,first_login

)

select 
    distinct a.id,b.name 
from 
    answer_tbl a join Accounts b on
    a.id = b.id
    order by a.id
    

```
