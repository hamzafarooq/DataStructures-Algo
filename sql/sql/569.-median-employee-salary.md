```sql
+-----+------------+--------+
|Id   | Company    | Salary |
+-----+------------+--------+
|1    | A          | 2341   |
|2    | A          | 341    |
|3    | A          | 15     |
|4    | A          | 15314  |
|5    | A          | 451    |
|6    | A          | 513    |
|7    | B          | 15     |
|8    | B          | 13     |
|9    | B          | 1154   |
|10   | B          | 1345   |
|11   | B          | 1221   |
|12   | B          | 234    |
|13   | C          | 2345   |
|14   | C          | 2645   |
|15   | C          | 2645   |
|16   | C          | 2652   |
|17   | C          | 65     |
+-----+------------+--------+
```

```sql
select  Id, Company,Salary from
(
select 
    Id, Company, Salary, 
    case when cnt % 2 = 1 then if(rnk=0.5*(cnt+1),1,0)
         when cnt % 2 = 0 then if(rnk=0.5*cnt or rnk=(0.5*cnt)+1,1,0) end as k
         
from
(
    
select 
 Id,Company, Salary,row_number() over (partition by Company order by Salary) as rnk, 
    count(Id) over (partition by Company) as cnt
from
    Employee) a
    )b 
    
where k = 1
```

Another good way of solving this

```sql
with ordering as (
select 
    Company,Id,Salary, 
    row_number() over(partition by Company order by Salary desc) as top_rank,
    row_number() over (partition by Company order by Salary ) as low_rank
from Employee
order by 1,3 )

select min(Id) as Id ,Company, Salary
from ordering
where top_rank = low_rank or top_rank + 1 = low_rank or top_rank -1 = low_rank
group by 2,3


```
