# 571. Find Median Given Frequency of Numbers

For a stream of numbers, it will be useful to convert the numbers in to count and then utilize the code below

```sql
+----------+-------------+
|  Number  |  Frequency  |
+----------+-------------|
|  0       |  7          |
|  1       |  1          |
|  2       |  3          |
|  3       |  1          |
+----------+-------------+
```

```sql
WITH tmp AS (SELECT Number, Frequency,
             SUM(Frequency) OVER (ORDER BY Number ASC) rk1,
             SUM(Frequency) OVER (ORDER BY Number DESC) rk2
             FROM Numbers)
             
             
select avg(Number) as median from tmp 
where abs(rk1-rk2) <= Frequency
```
